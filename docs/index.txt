Overview
########

:code:`dsigma` is an easy-to-use python package for measuring gravitational galaxy-galaxy lensing. Using a lensing catalog, it estimates excess surface density around a population of lenses, such as galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey or the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey. It has a broadly applicable API and can utilize data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), and the Hyper-Suprime Cam (HSC) lensing surveys, among others. With core computations written in C, :code:`dsigma` is very fast. Additionally, :code:`dsigma` provides out-of-the-box support for estimating covariances with jackknife resampling and calculating various summary statistics. Below is a plot showing the excess surface density around galaxies in the CMASS sample calculated with :code:`dsigma`.
