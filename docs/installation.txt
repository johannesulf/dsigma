Installation
############

The easiest way to install :code:`dsigma` is to use :code:`pip`. This will automatically install the package and all its dependencies.

.. code-block:: none

    pip install dsigma

The following packages will be installed alongside :code:`dsigma` if not installed already.

* :code:`numpy`
* :code:`scipy`
* :code:`astropy`
* :code:`scikit-learn`
* :code:`astropy-healpix`
* :code:`tqdm`

Additionally, for calculating the lens magnification bias, the installation of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) code :code:`camb` is recommended. However,  this is no hard requirement and :code:`dsigma` will run fine without it.

#### Apple M1

:code:`dsigma` uses C code that, by default, is compiled with the compiler flag :code:`--march=native`. This may cause an error on Apple M1 if the Clang compiler is not updated to at least version 15.0. To install :code:`dsigma`, either update Clang or install :code:`dsigma` manually without the :code:`-march=native` flag.
