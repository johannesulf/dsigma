To install :code:`dsigma`, you can use pip or clone the source code from GitHub.

**********************
Automatic Installation
**********************

The easiest way to install :code:`dsigma` is to use :code:`pip` to install the latest stable version from the Python Package Index (PyPI). This will automatically install the package and all its dependencies.

.. code-block:: none

    pip install dsigma

The following packages will be installed alongside :code:`dsigma` if not installed already.

* :code:`numpy`
* :code:`scipy`
* :code:`astropy`
* :code:`scikit-learn`
* :code:`astropy-healpix`
* :code:`tqdm`

Additionally, for calculating the lens magnification bias, the installation of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) code :code:`camb` is recommended. However,  this is no hard requirement and :code:`dsigma` will run fine without it.

*******************
Manual Installation
*******************

You can install :code:`dsigma` directly from the source code. This allows you to, for example, use versions of :code:`dsigma` not yet released on PyPI and to change compiler flags for the C code. The following code will install the most recent version of :code:`dsigma` on GitHub.

.. code-block:: none

    git clone https://github.com/johannesulf/dsigma.git
    cd dsigma
    pip install .

Note :code:`dsigma` uses C code that, by default, is compiled with the compiler flag :code:`--march=native`. This may cause an error, for example, on Apple M1 if the Clang compiler is not updated to at least version 15.0. If you don't want to update Clang, you can deactivate the :code:`-march=native` compiler flag by editing the file :code:`setup.py` in the main directory :code:`dsigma` before installing the code with :code:`pip`.
