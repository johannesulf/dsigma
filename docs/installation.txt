Installation
############

The easiest way to install :code:`dsigma` is to use :code:`pip`. This will automatically install the package and all its dependencies.

.. code-block:: none

    pip install dsigma

The following packages will be installed alongside :code:`dsigma` if not installed already.

* :code:`numpy`
* :code:`scipy`
* :code:`astropy`
* :code:`scikit-learn`
* :code:`healpy`

Additionally, for calculating the lens magnification bias, the installation of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) code :code:`camb` is recommended. However,  this is no hard requirement and :code:`dsigma` will run fine without it.
